/**
 * Algorithm5.1: Given a queue Q, you are requested to reverse the order in Q using an additional data
 * structure object.
 * Algorithm5.2: Write a method that receive two stacksâ€™ objects S1 and S2. The method returns true if the
 * two stacks are identical, false otherwise. The two stacks should be unchanged when the method
 * terminates.
 * Algorithm5.3: Re-do exercise 5.2 for a queue
 * Algorithm5.4: Update the third element in the queue with a new value VAL, leaving the queue
 * unchanged
 * Algorithm5.5: Update the third element in the queue with a new value VAL, leaving the queue
 * unchanged.?
 * Algorithm5.6: Given a stack of elements S1, you are requested to create an exact copy of S1 leaving S1
 * unchanged. Use only the stack predefined methods and an additional data structure object.
